"""
Modes for the spoofer:
The normal mode:
    This will use pretty normal characters, but different enough.
Crazy mode:
    This will use obscure characters to confuse the data reader.

different modes for different types?
1 for scripts, tricks google
2 for added characters
3 for craziness?
#scripts tend to work
better in google, rather than accent marks and other things.
Tags:
    -u: URL Mode
    -s: spoof Mode
