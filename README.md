# URLEncoder
Changing a string into different encodings and back.  
Currently, I plan on having a encoder and decoder from ASCII to URL and vice versa.  

# Look-a-like
Also, I want add a look-a-like plan to this. For instance, changing a Y into a Yen, in order to try to trick a system. Sometimes, it uses the best fit for a character. This is to make that a reality.
